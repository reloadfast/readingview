# Open Library Integration

The release tracker uses [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org) for automatic book lookup. No API key required.

## Adding Books

Three methods available in the **Release Tracker** → **Add Tracking** tab:

1. **Search Open Library** — search by title, author, or series; auto-fills book details
2. **From Your Audiobooks** — import authors already in your Audiobookshelf library
3. **Manual Entry** — enter all details by hand

## Search Tips

| Goal | Search type | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Specific book | Title | `Wind and Truth` |
| All books by author | Author | `Brandon Sanderson` |
| Books in a series | Series | `Stormlight Archive` |
| Broad match | General | `Sanderson Stormlight` |

- Keep search terms simple — fewer words work better
- If no results, try searching by author name only
- Click the Open Library link on any result to verify it's the right book
- Use the covers toggle and results slider to adjust the view

## What Gets Auto-Filled

When you select a search result:
- Book title and author
- Open Library link

You still need to add:
- Release date (from publisher/author announcements)
- Whether the date is confirmed or tentative
- Series name and book number (if applicable)
- Optional links (Goodreads, Amazon) and notes

## Where to Get Release Dates

Open Library catalogs published books, so future release dates come from:
- Publisher websites (Tor.com, Penguin Random House, etc.)
- Author websites, blogs, and social media
- Goodreads and Amazon pre-order pages

## Privacy

Searches send only your search terms to Open Library — no personal information. All tracking data stays in your local database.
